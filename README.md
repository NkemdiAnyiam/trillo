# trillo
Trillo is a website for a fake hotel app made during Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS and Sass course. The layout is organized primarily with Flexbox.

View the site here: https://nkemdianyiam.github.io/trillo/. Any button that's supposed to take you to another page does not actually function.
